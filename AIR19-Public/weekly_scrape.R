# Scraping AIR Jobs page https://www.airweb.org/Careers/Pages/Jobs.aspx
# This script calls a function, update_jobs_data, which itself calls another
# (jobs_board_scrape) that together pull data from the jobs board, make minor edits,
# and append to existing data.
# This script will be run on a regular basis (despite my best efforts, I could not
# get TaskScheduler to work appropriately) on the 5th, 12th, 19th, and 26th of
#  every month from Nov 2018 to May 2019 (perhaps longer).

# Git version control was initiated mid-January 2019.

# AIR began launching a redesigned website in late January 2019, and hosted a temporary,
# non-interactive Jobs Board starting then. The interactive version and thus job
# descriptions were last known to be available around  2019-01-19.
